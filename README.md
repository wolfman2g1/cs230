The Gaming Room wanted to expand their game... from a single platform to a multiplatform application that was scalable and allowed multiple instances of the game to run.

I believe I did particularly well in breaking down the requirements into clear design componentsâ€”such as the class structure, singleton pattern for the game service, and the separation of concerns between entities like Game, Team, and Player. 
If I were to revise any part of my work, I would refine the section on platform and architecture recommendations.
